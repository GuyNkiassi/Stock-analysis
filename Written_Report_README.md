 # Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
we wanted to help Steve to analyse diffrent stocks similar to Daqo (DQ). for this purpose, we resuse the same code that ran for allstockanalysis. however, this one was a little refactored to add red and green color to show the diifrence betwen stocks performance. the list of stocks and their daily performance help us to analyse trade and yearly return (percentage in price from the begining to the end of the year) for each stock. we were able to visualize with our memory, looping and using conditional statemnt to show positive return as green and negative returns as red. The red and green colors made it easier to see how which stock performed well. VBA provided a run time to calculate how long the code  to execute and output the elapsed to in a message box. 
### Purpose
The purpose is to expand a new set of data that include the entire stock market over the last few years. The project shows how the refactor code can be analysed in an effecient amount of time. we visualize the data, we looped all datasets only one time to ouput the total volume and yearly return. The execution time of the dataset for 2018 as seen on the screenshot is 0.3515625 seconds for the year 2018 compare to 2017 which ruan for 0.1601563 seconds averaging a difference of 0.19 seconds. the difference would have been noticeable with a larger datasets. The stock performance on the other hand looks similar to me. not much movement. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The challenge encountered would have been the time and money spend to reproduce the orginal code and start anaylzing it from scracth in order to make these changes. I also think, to optimize this scprit we must have a good understanding of the original code which is time consuming. The advantage of this code is faster runtime. Requires less steps, less memory and only loops through all the data one time.

### Pros and Cons
The code of the refactored allowed for a faster runtime to calculate execution times. the lower the execution time and heightened effeciency of the code is a in my view a Pro. whereas a Con can be just the understading of the original code and how to incorporate arrays for effeciency.
